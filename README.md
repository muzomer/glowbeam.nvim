# Glowbeam colorscheme

Fork of https://github.com/cooperuser/glowbeam.nvim. 

Kudos to https://github.com/cooperuser for the great choice of colors.

## Why a fork?

There are no updates in the original repository since long time. As the selection of colors are great to me, I thought better to fork it and apply the modifications I wish to add, and keep it maintained for my personal use.
