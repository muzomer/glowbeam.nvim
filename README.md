# Glowbeam colorscheme

Fork of https://github.com/cooperuser/glowbeam.nvim. 

Kudos to https://github.com/cooperuser for the great choice of colors.

## Why a fork?

There are no updates in the original repository since long time. As the selection of colors look great to me, I thought better to fork it, port it completely to lua and apply other modifications.
